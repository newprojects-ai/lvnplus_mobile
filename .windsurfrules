# NativeScript Development Guidelines

## Package Management

- You are a nativescript, typescript expert for Web, iOS, Android and Vision Pro apps.
- Always opt for the latest version when installing npm packages.
- If an .env needs to be created then do it and prefill the key+values and tell the user that its necessary to fill the value.
- If you need to install new packages with npm then be sure to stop and restart the server.
- Avoid downgrading packages in package.json; stay at latest version.

## Code Style and Structure

- Organize code using modular components and services for maintainability.
- Use platform-specific files (`.ios.ts`, `.android.ts`) when code exceeds 10 platform-specific lines.
- Avoid deep nesting; keep methods and logic under 20 lines.
- Use `Observable` and `ObservableArray` for reactive data binding.

## Naming Conventions

- Use 'camelCase' for variables, methods, and functions.
- Use 'PascalCase' for classes and components.
- Prefix platform-specific files or variables with 'ios' or 'android' (e.g., 'iosButtonStyle').
- Name custom components and styles descriptively ('primaryButtonStyle', 'userProfileView').

## Usage

- Use '@NativeClass()' to extend native classes when needed; always retain custom delegate instances to prevent garbage collection.
- Favor '.ios.android' and 'global.isIos' for conditional platform code with tree-shaking.
- Track and clean up all timers ('setTimeout', 'setInterval') to avoid memory leaks.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces or 4 spaces, project-dependent).
- Follow TypeScript/JavaScript linting rules with tools like ESLint or TSLint.
- Avoid inline styles in XML; keep styles in a separate CSS file.
- Always declare variables with 'let' or 'const'.

## UI and Styling

- Use TailwindCSS as main CSS Framework
- Disable Tailwind's autoloading to prevent conflicts when customizing PostCSS
- ns config set tailwind.autoload false
- Add ios: and android: style variants for platform-specific styling, (addVariant('android', '.ns-android &'), addVariant('ios', '.ns-ios &'))
- Leverage 'GridLayout' or 'FlexboxLayout' for flexible, responsive layouts.
- Use 'visibility: hidden' for elements that should not affect layout when hidden.
- Place resized images in platform-specific directories under 'App_Resources/<platform>'.

## Performance Optimization

- Avoid direct manipulation of the visual tree during runtime to minimize rendering overhead.
- Use 'hidden' and 'visibility' properties instead of 'v-if' or 'ngIf' for frequently toggled elements.
- Optimize images using compression tools like TinyPNG to reduce memory and app size.
- Clean the project ('ns clean') after modifying files in 'App_Resources'.

## Key Conventions

- Reuse components and styles to avoid duplication.
- Use template selectors ('itemTemplateSelector') for conditional layouts in 'ListView' and 'RadListView'.
- Minimize computations in UI bindings or methods.
- Ensure 'Observable' properties are updated to reflect state changes efficiently.
