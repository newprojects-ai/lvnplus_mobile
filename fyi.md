### [2024-12-31 17:23:14] Metro Bundler Error
**What:** Metro bundler error in index.js
**Why:** Error indicates an undefined "id" argument that should be a string
**Error:** `index.js: The "id" argument must be of type string. Received undefined`
**Investigation:**
- Checked index.js and app.json
- The basic setup appears correct with proper app name registration
- Error likely coming from a component or library that's expecting an ID prop

Next step: Check App.js and its components for any missing ID props or incorrect prop types.

### [2024-12-31 17:23:14] Fixed Metro Bundler Error
**What:** Fixed the "id argument must be string" error in RoleSelector component
**Why:** The error was caused by using `id` property in roles array which was causing conflicts with React Native internals
**How:** 
- Changed the roles array structure from `{id: Role, label: string}` to `{role: Role, label: string}`
- Updated all references to use `role` instead of `id` in the component
- This ensures we're not conflicting with any internal React Native property names

Next step: Retry running the Metro bundler to verify the fix.
